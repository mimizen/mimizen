## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Michelle!

- ðŸ”­ Human-Computer-Interaction student @ LMU Munich
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on indie games and mental health applications

- ðŸ‘¯ I'm researching methods to design gamified digital experiences that empower people to break free from negative thoughts and emotions. If you're interested on what we've been doing so far, feel free to check out our publication [Mind Mansion: Exploring Metaphorical Interactions to Engange With Negative Thoughts in Virtual Reality](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3643834.3661557)

- âš¡ Fun fact: I love cakes and concerts
